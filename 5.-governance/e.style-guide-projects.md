# Style Guides
## Overview

Style guides add consistency, reusability, and easy governance throughout your API program. Tailor the experience for creating style guides with a dedicated project type managed by workspace owners or administrators. Build custom rules, custom functions, errors, and validations. Share enforceable style guides across projects, business units, or workspace groups.

Style Guides add value to your API program:
* Produce higher quality API design.
* Pass quality and security reviews.
* Get APIs to market faster and better.


### Publishing Style Guides

Each published style guide generates documentation for errors and responses. Easily socialize the style guide within the company.

Use Continuous integration (CI) pipelines, such as Spectral-cli and Spectral action, to enforce style guides for different Git repositories.


### Consuming Style Guides

Add style guides to your Studio design from a list of shared style guides. Provide more flexibility and control of your API design workflow by overriding rules in your project and skipping style guides for certain APIs, endpoints, or models. When a style guide is updated, you receive a notification to ensure you're always using the latest version of the organization's style guide.


### API Design Workflow

**Governance:** Makes governance easier and accessible.   
**Design:** Use a style guide as an integrated, easy part of the design process.   
**Development:** Develop faster and better with approved designs that pass compliance checks.
