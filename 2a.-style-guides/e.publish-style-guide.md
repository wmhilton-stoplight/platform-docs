# Publish a Style Guide

<!-- theme: info -->
<!--Shared style guides are available on the **Professional** and **Enterprise** plans.--> 

> This is a limited access feature. Reach out to nauman@stoplight.io for more information.

Publish your style guide so it can be enabled for API projects in the workspace.

> If your style guide contains [validation errors](k-validate-style-guides.md), the **Publish** button is disabled.

1. When you are ready to share your style guide, select **Publish**.
2. On the **Publish** window, provide a commit message for your updates. This information is shown to users who may need to adopt your updates.

As you make changes to your style guide and republish it, you will need to refresh the style guide in the projects that use it.
