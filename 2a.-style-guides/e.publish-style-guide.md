# Publish a Style Guide

<!-- theme: info -->
>Shared style guides are available on the **Professional** and **Enterprise** plans.  

Publish your style guide so it can be enabled for API projects in the workspace.

1. When you are ready to share your style guide, select **Publish**.
2. On the **Publish** window, provide a commit message for your updates. This information is shown to users who may need to adopt your updates.

3. The first time you publish a style guide, the **Share Project** window opens. You can share the style guide now or later from the **Share** button.

As you make changes to your style guides and republish it, you will need to refresh the style guide in the projects that use it.
