# Rule Examples

The [Stoplight Style Guide](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/docs/stoplight-style-guide) provides a set of targets and rules for all API projects. You can use the rules as-is, disable them, or create your own rules. 

The examples in this section explain how to create custom rules in the Stoplight Rule Editor:

In some cases, the examples use targets from the [Stoplight Style Guide](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/docs/stoplight-style-guide). In other cases, targets must be created. To simplify the examples, inline targets are created, but you may want to create saved targets so they can be used in multiple rules. See [Create Targets](b-create-targets.md).
