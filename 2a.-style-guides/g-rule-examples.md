# Rule Examples

Stoplight provides a set of public style guides that you can use as-is or to define rules specific to your API program.

Public style guides include:

* **[Stoplight Style Guide](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/docs/stoplight-style-guide)**:  Provides a set of targets and rules for all API projects. You can use the rules as-is, disable them, or create your own rules. 
* **[URL Guidelines](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/docs/url-guidelines)**: Provides rules that enforce best practices and naming standards for URLs (Professional plan and above).
* **[Enforce HTTPS](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/docs/enforce-https)**: Provides rules that enforce https for OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 API (Professional plan and above).
