# Reuse and Customize Rules

Many rules can be used as-is, but some may need some slight modifications to meet your organization's needs.

To reuse rules:

1. Edit any project, and then select the **Styles** tab.
2. Select **Manage Style Guides**.

![Enable Style Guides](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjI/images/peSGe4wXhj0)


3. Scroll to the **Public Style Guides** section, and then select **Enable** for the style guides of your choice. 

<!--

![Enable public style guides](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjI/images/VvPJU4c7G9o)

> The Stoplight Style Guide is enabled for all projects by default.

4. Save your changes.
5. Expand the **Inherited** section, then expand the style guide that contains the inherited rule.
6. Select the rule you want to customize.
7. From the **Rule Editor**, select the **duplicate** icon. The duplicated rule is added to the **Local Rules** section.

7. Change any of the rule's settings. For the example above, you may want to change the name, message, and notMatch criteria to ensure developers don't use an old server URL.

Once you've modified the duplicated rules, [disable them](j-disable-rules.md) in the originating style guide.
