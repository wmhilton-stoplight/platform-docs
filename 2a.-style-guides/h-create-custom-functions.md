# Create Custom Functions

<!-- theme: warning -->
>**Warning**:
>Limited early access content for Shared Style Guides. Shared style guides are available on the **Professional** and **Enterprise** plans for early access participants. 

Stoplight's [core functions](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/ZG9jOjExNg-core-functions) are intended to meet most rule validation needs, but you may need functions to solve advanced use cases.

Custom functions are any JavaScript function compliant with the `RulesetFunction` type. See our guidance for [writing custom functions](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/ZG9jOjI1MTkw-custom-functions#writing-functions). 

Once you've written custom functions, add them to your style guide and use them to evaulate rules. 

<!--Question: Can custom functions be edited once they are published? -->
