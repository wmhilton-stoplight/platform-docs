# Update Style Guides

<!-- theme: info -->
>Shared style guides are available on the **Professional** and **Enterprise** plans.  

Style guides are meant to be dynamic documents that change as your organization grows and adopts API governance best practices.

When a style guide that has been enabled for a project changes, an **Alert** icon appears on the **Styles** tab and on the **Overview** page.

You can update the enabled style guide immediately or wait until a more convenient time.

1. Edit an API project that has an enabled style guide.
2. Select the **Styles** tab.
3. Select the **Overview** page. 
4. Select **Update Available**. 
5. Review the commit messages so you can decide if you want to take the updates or wait until a later time.
