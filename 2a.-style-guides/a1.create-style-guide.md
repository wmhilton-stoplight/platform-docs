# Create a Style Guide

All API projects include the [Stoplight Style Guide](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/docs/stoplight-style-guide) by default. You can use or disable rules for the Stoplight Style Guide on any plan. 

You can:

* Create your own style guide
* Import an existing Spectral ruleset as a starting point

Depending on your plan, once your style guide is created:

* Create rules that enforce your styles and standards. See [Create Rules](c-create-rules.md).
* Reuse and customize rules from other style guides. See [Reuse Rules](reuse-and-customize-rules.md).
* Publish the style guide. See [Publish Style Guides](e.publish-style-guide.md).
* Enable the style guide for API projects. See [Enable Style Guides](d-enable-style-guide.md).

## Style Guide Projects

Style guide projects only contain targets, rules, and functions. Like traditional projects, you can share the style guide with other collaborators and publish style guide documentation so others can learn about your governance program.

Style guide access guidelines:

* Only workspace owners and administrators can create style guide projects. 
* Style guides always have internal visibility, meaning they're only available for workspace members. 
* Members who can edit API projects can enable style guides for those projects. See [Project Roles](../2.-workspaces/l.project-roles.md#project-roles) for more information. 

### Create a Style Guide Project

To create a style guide project:

1. Log in to your workspace, and then select the **Add** icon (+) at the top of the left pane.
2. From the **Create or Import a Project** page, select the **Style Guide** tab.

3. Select one of these options:
    - **Create Style Guide**: Use this option to start from scratch. Provide a project name, visibility level, and, optionally, a group to help organize your projects (Professional plan and above).
    - **Import Spectral File**: Use this option to import an existing [Spectral file](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/ZG9jOjI1MTg5-custom-rulesets). Choose the file to import, name your project, and, optionally, a group (Professional plan and above).
4. Select **Create Style Guide**.

## Local Style Guides

Local style guides are embedded within an API project. They can't be shared with other projects.

You can add custom rules, targets, and functions to local style guides. 

You can also enable shared and public style guides to add inherited rules to an API project. Once you do this, you can override the severity and disable inherited rules as needed.
