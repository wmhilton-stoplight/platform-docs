# Create a Style Guide

All API projects include the [Stoplight Style Guide](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/docs/stoplight-style-guide) by default. You can use or modify the Stoplight Style Guide on any plan. On Professional and Enterprise plans, you can create your own shared style guide or import an existing Spectral ruleset as a starting point.

## Style Guide Projects

Style guide projects only contain targets, rules, and custom functions. Like traditional projects, you can share the style guide with other collaborators and publish style guide documentation so others can learn about your governance program.

Style guide access guidelines:

* Only workspace owners and aministrators can create style guide projects. 
* Style guides always have internal visibility, meaning they are only available for workspace members. 
* Members who can edit API projects can enable style guides for those projects. See [Project Roles](../2.-workspaces/l.project-roles.md#project-roles) for more information. 

### Create a Style Guide Project

To create a style guide project:

1. Log in to your workspace, and then select the **Add** icon (+) at the top of the left pane.
2. From the **Create or Import a Project** page, select the **Style Guide** tab.

3. Select one of these options:
    - **Create Style Guide**: Use this option to start from scratch. Provide a project name, visibility level, and, optionally, a group to help organize your projects (Professional plan and above).
    - **Import Spectral File**: Use this option to import an existing [Spectral file](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/ZG9jOjI1MTg5-custom-rulesets). Choose the file to import, name your project, and, optionally, a group (Professional plan and above).
4. Select **Create Style Guide**.

Once your style guide is created:

* Create targets to reference commonly used areas of API specification documents, such as OpenAPI or AsyncAPI, in rules. See [Create Targets](b-create-targets.md).
* Create rules that enforce your styles and standards. See [Create Rules](c-create-rules.md).
* Publish the style guide. See [Publish Style Guides](e.publish-style-guide.md).
* Enable the style guide for API projects. See [Enable Style Guides](d-enable-style-guide.md).
* Periodically refresh style guides to consume updates. See [Refresh Style Guides](f.refresh-style-guide.md).

## Local Style Guides

Local style guides are embedded within an API project. They cannot be shared with other projects.

You can add custom rules, targets, and functions to the default style guide. You can also override the severity of rules and disable default rules as needed.

## Imported Style Guides

You can import Spectral files that you've created or that have been shared with you. 

When you import Spectral files into an API project, all local rules, targets, and custom functions are replaced. Inherited rules, targets, and functions are not impacted.

To import a Spectral file:

1. Edit an API project.
2. Select **Add ( + )**, and then select **Import Syle Guide**.
3. Navigate to and select the Spectral file you want to import.
4. Confirm that you understand that your local rules, targets, and functions will be overwritten.
