# Import Style Guides

You can import [Spectral](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/e5b9616d6d50c-custom-rulesets) files that you've created or that have been shared with you. 

This is useful when you have a ruleset that's maintained outside of Stoplight. When changes are made to a Spectral ruleset, you can reimport a new version of the file to replace the old ruleset.

When you import Spectral files into a project, all local rules, targets, and custom functions are replaced. Inherited rules, targets, and functions aren't impacted. 

To import a Spectral file:

1. Edit an API or style guide project.
2. Select the **Add** icon (+), and then select **Import Style Guide**.
3. Navigate to and select the Spectral file you want to import.
4. Confirm that you understand that your local rules, targets, and functions will be overwritten.
