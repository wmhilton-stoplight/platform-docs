# Sidebar Customization

The Stoplight sidebar changes depending on who you are, what page you're viewing, and the customizations made to your site.

To learn more about sidebar customization, see our [best practices for configuring Stoplight navigation](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/api-best-practices/hosted-docs/stoplight-navigation). 

## Workspace Projects List

For **anonymous users**, the workspace sidebar shows public projects and public groups. 

<!--
focus: center
bg: "#1A202C"
-->

For **authenticated workspace members**, the workspace sidebar shows the projects and groups you've pinned or created. 

<!--
focus: center
bg: "#1A202C"
-->
![member-workspace-sidebar.png](../../assets/images/member-workspace-sidebar.png)

For **workspace guests**, the sidebar is [automatically populated](a.workspace-sidebar.md#guest-sidebar-visibility) with public projects and projects the guests have been invited to.

## Project Table of Contents

The project sidebar contains API descriptions and documentation. You can use the [default order](d.table-of-contents.md#the-default-structure) or use a [Table of Contents](d.table-of-contents.md) file to customize the order and structure of your project sidebar.
