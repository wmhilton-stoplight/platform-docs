# Workspace Sidebar

The sidebar is the primary navigation for all workspaces and contains the following elements:

1. **Search** - Available to all users, but only returns results for Projects users have access to.
2. **Explore** - Available to logged-in workspace members only. The explorer makes it easier to find, search, and manage all available API artifacts.
3. **Projects** - For workspace members, all projects that you've joined or created are shown in the sidebar. External users (those not logged in) see only public projects. Learn to [manage project-level access](../../2.-workspaces/l.project-roles.md).
4. **Groups** - Customers on either *Professional* or *Enterprise* plans can further control their sidebars by creating groups of projects. Learn more about [Groups](../../2.-workspaces/m.groups.md).

## Join Projects & Groups
All logged-in workspace members, except guests, can populate their sidebar by navigating to the Projects list or Groups list, then **joining** or **leaving** relevant projects and groups.

## Guest Sidebar Visibility

To help ease project setup, the sidebar for guests automatically shows:

- Public projects
- Projects that guests have been invited to
- Non-private projects in groups that guests have been invited to
