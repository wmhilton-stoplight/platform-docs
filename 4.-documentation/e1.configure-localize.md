## Overview

[Localize](https://localizejs.com/) offers powerful solutions for automating the translation of web, backend, mobile, and file based content, saving you time and money with tools and libraries that your developers will love.

> This feature is available on the [Stoplight **Professional** plan](https://stoplight.io/pricing/), and above.

## How it works

Within your Stoplight Workspace, you can configure your Localize project key and a custom domain. Then when your workspace is loaded from your custom domain, the Localize widget will be included and will automatically begin detecting new content on pages you visit.

Here are the steps to get started:

1. [Create a free Localize account](https://app.localizejs.com/login/to/organization/) and copy your [project key](https://app.localizejs.com/organization/api-keys) (Eg. `1b4xxxxxxxxe5`).

2. Navigate to your Stoplight workspace settings and [configure your custom domain](../2.-workspaces/j.custom-domains.md).
3. Enter your Localize project key and hit save.

Now when you load your workspace from your custom domain, you'll see the Localize widget in the bottom right of the screen. For more information on widget customization, please see [Localize's documentation](https://help.localizejs.com/docs/widget-customization).
