# Adding Images

Adding images in Stoplight is now easier than ever. Add images to your project to create beautiful documentation layouts that supplement text content.

## Why add Images?

Visual help on your documentation compliments the text on it, and gets your users to their goals faster. Add flowcharts, infographics or screenshots on pages like **Getting Started guides** and **Authentication guides** to help explain flows and use cases better. 

You can add multiple images within a documentation file. 

<!-- theme: info -->
> üëâ **Note:** Supported  image formats include: **JPEG,** **JPG**, **PNG** and **GIF**.

## Adding Images to Projects

Drag and drop an image or copy and paste an image into a markdown article to upload it.

> These images are stored in Stoplight and respect project permissions (private vs. internal).

## Customize Images

**Splendid! Your documentation now contains images. Your users are gonna love it üëè**
