# Publish Stoplight Projects

The quickest and easiest way to publish is to use Stoplight projects. These projects are not connected to a repository or version control system, and data is stored in the Stoplight database. Changes are immediately published.

To publish Stoplight projects:

1. Edit a Stoplight project in your workspace.
2. Change or add content to API descriptions or documentation.
3. Select **Publish**. 
4. Select **Back to Workspace** to see the published content.
