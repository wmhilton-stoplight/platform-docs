# Publish Stoplight Projects

The quickest and easiest way to publish is to use Stoplight web projects. Web projects aren't connected to a repository or version control system, and data is stored in the Stoplight database. Changes are immediately published.

To publish Stoplight projects:

1. Edit a Stoplight project in your workspace.
2. Change or add content to API descriptions or documentation.
3. Select **Publish**. 
4. Select **Back to Workspace** to see the published content.

## Discard Changes

You can discard changes made since the last published content of a project. Be aware that this action impacts unpublished changes made by all users and not just the user performing the discard.

To discard changes:

1. Select the down arrow on the **Publish** button.
2. Select **Discard changes since last publish**.
