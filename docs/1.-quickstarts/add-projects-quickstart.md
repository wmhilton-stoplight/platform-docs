# Add API Descriptions and Documentation

## What is a Project

Projects can contain anything you would expect to find in a repository: source code, API descriptions, images, Markdown articles, maybe some excel spreadsheets. Stoplight will analyze the contents of a project looking for things it knows what to do with, and ignore the rest.

Stoplight looks for: 

- API Description Documents (OpenAPI v2, OpenAPI v3, and JSON Schema)
- Markdown articles
- Images

## Connect an Existing Git Project

The quickest and recommended way to get projects into Stoplight is to pull them in from Git, and this can be done in Explorer.

![add-projects](../../assets/images/git-connect-compressed.gif)

1. Click on `+` sign on the top right, then click `Connect Repos`.
2. Click on the Git provider of your choice and then click `Connect with Your Git Provider`. Follow the instructions on the pop-up screen to authenticate.
4. Upon successful authentication, you should see your organizations listed. Choose the organization and select the repositories you want to import. Click `Add Projects`.

If the repository has Markdown articles or API descriptions, then you will see them show up.

Next, lets [share this project](share-documentation-quickstart.md). 

## Import Local Files or Create a Blank Project

If you don't have your API artifacts like OpenAPI or JSON schema on a Git repository or want to get started with creating a new one, you can get started in Studio. 

1. Click on `+` sign on the top right, then click `Start a new project with Stoplight Studio`.

### Import Existing Files

![import existing file](../../assets/images/import-existing-file.gif)

Click `Import` to Import existing OpenAPI descriptions, JSON Schemas, Images, or Documentation.

Play around, design, and edit using the intuitive interface.  

### Create new API Descriptions or Documentation

![create new API](../../assets/images/add-api-studio.gif)

Add an OpenAPI description, Json Schema, Article, or Images by clicking on `Add`.

### Promote to a Git repo (Recommended)
To start sharing this project you can promote it to a Git repo. This would create a Git repo and push the imported/newly created content always keeping it in sync with the changes within or outside Studio. 

![promote-to-git](../../assets/images/promote-to-git.gif)

Click `Push`, then click `Promote to  Git repo`. 

Choose your desired Git provider, organization, and name and click `Create Git Repository`.

Next, commit your changes with a message by clicking `Commit`. 

Next, lets [share this project](share-documentation-quickstart.md). 

### Push to workspace

If you don't want to push this content to a Git repo, you can push it to the workspace to start sharing it.

![push-to-workspace](../../assets/images/push-to-workspace.png)

Give it a useful name. Click `Push`, then click `Push to workspace`. 

Next, lets [share this project](share-documentation-quickstart.md).
