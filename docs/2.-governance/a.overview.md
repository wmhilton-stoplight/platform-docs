# Overview

API governance is about establishing, documenting and enforcing best practices relating to design, documentation, and testing across your APIs, allowing potentially large numbers of APIs written by all sorts of different developers to feel like a unified, coherent, consistent ecosystem. 

Effective governance consequentially ensures your APIs can be easily consumed by a wider audience, both within your enterprise (e.g., product managers, developer evangelists), and externally (e.g., partners, customers). The development and enforcement of standards also ensure that API teams focus on building new services instead of focusing on reinventing models, standards, and practices. When everyone at your organization is on the same page, your API platform will become efficient and valuable. 

The most critical use case of this is experienced by organizations when they are building a large number of APIs that require consistency, discoverability, and quality inside their organizations, often between different departments, which just might be on the other side of the world.
