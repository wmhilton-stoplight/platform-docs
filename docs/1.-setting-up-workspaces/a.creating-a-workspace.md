# Creating a workspace

Stoplight Platform enables you to drive consistency, discipline, and efficiency across your API teams by helping folks across your organization work in a collaborative manner. The first step to enabling collaboration across your API lifecycle is grouping them into workspaces. 

## What is a workspace?

Workspaces in Stoplight are used to group API projects across your organization to promote visibility, standards, and reuse of artifacts. Depending on the structure of your organization and goals of your API program a workspace can contain projects across your organization, a particular function or a team. 

To create a new workspace:

1. Open the [Stoplight Platform Homepage](<>) page or your On-Premise installation homepage
2.  Click on **My team isn't using Stoplight yet**.
    <!--To-Do: Screenshot from homepage-->
3.  Fill in the form by entering your **Work email address**. Next, input the **Workspace name**. Your workspace would be live at `workspace-name.stoplight.io`
    <!--theme:info-->
    > The workspace name can be 2-20 characters, only letters, numbers, and dashes
    >
    > By default, the Workspace name would be prefilled from your domain i.e `your-company-domain.stoplight.com`

Then click `Continue`.

4. Input the 6 digit confirmation code you received on your registered email address. Then click `Verify & Continue`
5. Congrats, you have created your workspace at Stoplight! Let's create Amazing APIs now. To go to your newly created workspace click `Go to your-workspace-name workspace` 

Next, [lets add your projects](b.adding-projects.md) to the workspace.
