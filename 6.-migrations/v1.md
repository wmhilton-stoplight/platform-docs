## How do I migrate?

> If you feel comfortable and ready to migrate, please follow the steps below. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:support@stoplight.io) and we will schedule time to assist you. 

### Create a New Stoplight Workspace

[Create a new Stoplight Workspace](../2.-workspaces/a.creating-a-workspace.md). Choose a domain (Preferably your company name) your workspace would be available at. 

### Import Projects

![add-projects](../assets/images/git-connect-compressed.gif)

Follow this [step-by-step guide](a.configuring-git.md) to connect the Git provider of your choice.

Next, [import all projects](../2.-workspaces/b.adding-projects.md) that you had added into your V1 workspace. 

### Invite Users

Currently Stoplight Platform supports the following Auth providers:

- LDAP
- SAML
- Bitbucket Cloud
- Bitbucket Server
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Gitea
- Azure Devops

To setup a auth provider of your choice, read our [Single Sign-on Documentation](../2.-workspaces/e.configuring-authentication.md).

Alternatively, you can also [invite members](../2.-workspaces/d.inviting-your-team.md) 
individually using their email.

The fastest way to get your team moved over to Stoplight Platform is to [configure an email domain](../2.-workspaces/d.inviting-your-team.md#make-your-workspace-discoverable) and share a link to your workspace's signup page. This would allow anybody with your company domain to join the workspace with the specified role.

Learn about the different workpsace roles [here](../2.-workspaces/k.workspace-roles.md).

> If you are using an enteprise git installation and need to configure your firewall to allow the conenction, please don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:support@stoplight.io) and we will schedule time to assist you. 

### Share Projects

V2 Platform comes with granular control over project permissions and visbility. Set appropriate project access by following this [guide](../2.-workspaces/l.project-roles.md).

### Use Mock Servers

V2 comes with up to date hosted mock servers to help speed up development. Follow this [guide](../3.-design/d.setting-up-a-mock-server.md) to get started with hosted mocking.

### Setup Design Libraries

<!-- theme: warning -->
> Design libraries in V2 are limited to existing V1 users only not available for everybody.

V2 comes with support for multiple design libraries. You can set complete git projects as design libraries unlike in V1 where you'd have to add schemas individually to a single design library. 

To set a project as a design library, go to the project settings and designate the project to a design library. 

![](../assets/images/design-library.png)

Next up go to the projects using design libraries, and update the links to point to the latest links. i.e. `'https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/{workspace-name}/{project-name}/nodes/{node-url}'`

> If you are a heavy user of design libraries, please don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:support@stoplight.io) and we will schedule time to assist with the migration. 



### Migrate Documentation

If you have published documentation for external stakeholders (customers, the general public, etc), you can [share your documentation](../1.-quickstarts/share-documentation-quickstart.md) by setting appropriate visbility settings.

You can also:
- [Setup a custom domain](../2.-workspaces/j.custom-domains.md)
- [Publish multiple versions using branches](../2.-workspaces/h.branch-management.md)
- [Configure analytics](../4.-documentation/e.configure-analytics.md)
- [Customize the sidebar](../4.-documentation/d.table-of-contents.md)
