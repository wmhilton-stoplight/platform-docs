# Introduction to Stoplight 

APIs have become the cornerstone of growth across organizations of all shapes and sizes. In the past, APIs might have been an afterthought, created to satisfy integration requirements at a later point. Now they drive core new business models, providing critical integrations, and improving efficiency throughout multiple products.

The rise in importance means **shipping poorly planned APIs isn't an option anymore**, and Stoplight aims to bring together all the tools you need to make sure your APIs are the best they can be.
		
### What's Stoplight?

Stoplight offers tooling across the API lifecycle that helps you build quality APIs efficiently. With Stoplight, your team can:

<!--

# <i class="fas fa-magic"> </i> Design

Help API architects **design excellent APIs quickly** providing machine-readable API descriptions using standards (like OpenAPI), through an easy-to-use intuitive UI.

<!--
type: tab
title: Develop
-->

# <i class="fas fa-laptop-code"> </i> Develop

Allow your API developers to create prototype APIs with no code using out-of-the-box mocking servers, to **develop APIs and API clients in parallel** instead of using the waterfall model.

<!--

title: Document
-->

# <i class="fad fa-book"> </i> Document

**Provide an amazing developer experience for your internal and external developers** by publishing beautiful documentation, with a built-in HTTP client and code samples.

<!--
type: tab
title: Collaborate
-->

# <i class="fas fa-users-class"> </i> Collaborate

Create workspaces, manage roles, and permissions, powered by integrated tooling on top of your favorite version control system to **collaborate in real-time without losing your single source of truth**.

<!--
type: tab
title: Govern
-->

# <i class="fas fa-crown"> </i> Govern

**Promote reuse, consistency, and quality across your company** by exploring artifacts, creating common design libraries using Stoplight's powerful Explorer, and leveraging automated style guides to make sure your APIs are the best they can be.

<!--

Stoplight is powered by industry-leading standards that help your team onboard faster and with tooling without being locked in at any part of the lifecycle. Stoplight's tooling is based on:
		
  * OpenAPI Specification
  * JSON Schema
  * Markdown
  * Git

<!-- theme: info -->

Any files you create or import into Stoplight can live in your existing version control systems so you maintain full control over your source of truth always, with no awkward syncs or repetitive import/export cycles.
