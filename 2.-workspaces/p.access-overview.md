# Access Overview

<!-- this topic is currently not published in the toc -->
Stoplight is an all-in-one platform that covers all integral parts of the API lifecycle including design, documentation, development, and governance. This requires different stakeholders from your organization to be on the platform.

Having all of your collaborators on a single platform helps promote **visibility** and **reusability** of artifacts across your organization, but you may need different levels of access for your stakeholders.

## Workspace Access

Workspace-wide access is provided through [roles](k.workspace-roles.md): guest, viewer, maker, billing admin, admin, and owner. 

You can set the role when you [invite team members](d.inviting-your-team.md) to your workspace.

## Project Access

While workspace roles define workspace-wide access, not all projects need to be accessible or editable by everybody in the workspace. Visibility and role assignments within projects allow granular control over who can do what. 

[Project visibility](l.project-roles.md#project-visibility) determines who can view projects within or outside the organization. For example, public access allows anyone, including anoymous users, to view a project. 

[Project roles](l.project-roles.md#project-roles) provide granular control to individual projects. 

## Group Access

Use a combination of [visiblity type](o.group-access.md#group-visibility-and-access) (public and internal) and [group roles](o.group-access.md#group-roles) to assign bulk access to sets of projects.
