> Starting October 1, 2021, the callback URL for all SAML integrations must include the workspace slug. Other integrations are *not* affected. 


# Single Sign-On

Stoplight can connect with popular auth providers to simplify your authentication flows. 

## Auth Provider Support

We support the following Auth/Single Sign-On (SSO) providers:

- LDAP
- SAML
- Bitbucket Cloud
- Bitbucket Server
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Azure Devops

Stoplight currently supports multiple SAML integrations when  authentication starts from Stoplight. Only one integration where authentication starts from an identity provider (IDP) is supported per workspace. When you have multiple SAML integrations configured, you can specify which of these will serve as your IDP integration.

<!-- focus: center -->

To configure popular Git providers as auth providers follow [this guide](configure-git/a.configuring-git.md).

## SAML

> This feature is available on the Stoplight **Professional** plan and above.

Organizations that need enhanced security requirements can configure SAML SSO, allowing you to authenticate users to Stoplight with your own corporate Identity Provider (IdP).

### Prerequisites

Before continuing, be sure to:

- Contact the team responsible for your organization's SAML configuration for the following pieces of information that must be configured within Stoplight:
  - SAML Entry Point URL - This is the URL where applications integrating with a SAML IdP must first direct users
  - SAML Identifier Format - Stoplight defaults to using a "persistent" name identifier format, however some SAML providers require a specific format ("unspecified", for example)
- Some fields will also need to be configured within the SAML IdP directly. Pass along the following pieces of information to the team responsible for your organization's SAML configuration:
  - Issuer - This value defaults to "`stoplight`"
  <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
  - Callback URL - This value is provided during the configuration, and defaults to a value similar to **https://\<workspace\>.stoplight.io/oauth/callback**.
  <!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
  - Attributes - The attributes (described below) are required by Stoplight to successfully authenticate users.
- Be logged in to Stoplight as an administrator

### SAML Assertion Requirements 

In addition to the items above, the following SAML attributes need to be provided in the assertion data coming to Stoplight upon successful authentication with the SAML IdP:

- External ID - This corresponds to the "`nameID`" field in the SAML response
- Username - This corresponds to one of the following fields in the SAML response (in order of precedence):
  - `userName`
  - `urn:oid:2.5.4.42`
  - `displayName`
  - `urn:oid:2.5.4.4`
- Email - this corresponds to either the "`email`" or
  "`urn:oid:1.2.840.113549.1.9.1`" attributes

### Configuring the SAML Integration

To configure a SAML integration, navigate to your workspace
**Settings** screen, and then select the "SAML" integration option.

Which will open a dialog to configure the SAML settings for the integration:

![saml-settings.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjI/images/zvb9c5E72C0)

Configuration options include:
- Name - Customizable name users will see when authenticating
- Entry Point - SAML entrypoint provided by your identity provider.
- Identifier Format - This SAML ID format should match what your identity provider expencts. `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress` is typical.
- Identity Provider Public Certificate - Public certificate provided by your identity provider. Note that this must be in string format.
- Issuer - Should match what the identity provider expects.
- Callback Url - Read-only value to be set in your identity provider configuration. This callback URL must include your workspace name as of October 1st. For example, `https://<workspace>.stoplight.io/oauth/callback`.

> If your SAML IdP is behind a firewall, you may need to [add our IPs to your
> allowlist](../c.troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-allow-stoplight-to-access-an-internal-git-provider).

### SAML Integration Guides
Stoplight has tested Service Provider (SP) initiated and Identity Provider (IP) initiated flows for the following providers:

- [Azure](saml-walkthroughs/azure-integration-guide.md)
- [Okta](saml-walkthroughs/okta-integration-guide.md)
- [OneLogin](saml-walkthroughs/onelogin-integration-guide.md)
- [Ping](saml-walkthroughs/ping-integration-guide.md)


## LDAP

> This feature is available on the Stoplight **Professional** plan and above.

You can use a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication server to authenticate users with Stoplight. LDAP is an open-standard protocol for use with online directory services.

1. Navigate to the Integrations section in your Stoplight workspace settings. 
2. Click **Install/Configure** beside LDAP. 
3. Provide the following information:
 - **URL**: The LDAP host, e.g. **ldap://ldap.example.com**. If the hostname is behind a firewall, you may need to [add our IPs to your allowlist](../c.troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-allow-stoplight-to-access-an-internal-git-provider).
 - **Bind DN**: The LDAP user that performs user lookups to authenticate other users when they sign in. This is typically a service account created specifically for third-party integrations. Use a fully qualified name, such as **cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=Example,dc=com**.
 - **Bind Credentials**: The password for the domain search user.
 - **Search Base**: The fully qualified Distinguished Name (DN) of an LDAP subtree you want to search for users and groups. You can add as many as you like; however, each group must be defined in the same domain base as the users that belong to it. e.g. **dc=Example,dc=com**.
 - **Search Filter**: Filters can be used to restrict the numbers of users or groups that are permitted to access an application.  In essence, the filter limits what part of the LDAP tree the application syncs from.  Read more about writing filters [here.](https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/how-to-write-ldap-search-filters-792496933.html)
4. Click **Install**.
