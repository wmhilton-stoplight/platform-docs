# Governance Settings

## Style Guide Settings

Workspace owners and admins can set default style guides that are automatically enabled for new projects (Professional and Enterprise plans only). Owners and admins can also prevent project owners, admins, and editors from disabling default style guides. 

Learn more about [enabling style guides](../2a.-style-guides/d-enable-style-guide.md) for a project.

### Set Default Style Guides

Style guides are organized into two categories:

1. Workspace style guides are those that were created or imported into the workspace.
2. Public style guides are those that come from external sources. This includes the [Stoplight Style Guide](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/docs/stoplight-style-guide), which is the set as the initial default style guide for each workspace.

To set default style guides:

1. Select **Governance** from the workspace toolbar. 
2. Select **Default Style Guides**.
3. In the **Default Style Guides** dialog:
    * Select **Preview** to open the style guide documentation in a separate browser tab.
    * Select **Enable** to set one or more style guides as defaults.
    * Select **Disable** to remove style guides as default.
4. Select **Save**.

### Control Default Style Guides

By default, project owners, admins, and editors can disable default style guides for a project. You can prevent them from doing so, however, if you want to enforce style guide usage for your API program.

To control default style guides:

1. Select **Governance** from the workspace toolbar. 
2. Disable the **Allow disabling default style guides** toggle.
