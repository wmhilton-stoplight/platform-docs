# **Invite Team Members**

Once you have your **workspace** set up, you can invite your colleagues and partners to collaborate on API design, view documentation, and access mock servers.

You can invite up to 5 team members on the **Free** and **Starter** plan, then add more members as you scale up. 

## Allowed email domains

The fastest way to onboard your teammates is by configuring an [Allowed email domain](./allowed-email-domains.md) and sending them a link to your Workspace. Read more about allowed email domains [here](./allowed-email-domains.md).

## Inviting Team Members to your workspace

1. From the workspace home page, select **Members**. 

2. On the member settings page, select **Invite Members.** 

4.  Enter one or more work **Email Addresses** of your teammates, select a **Role**, and then select **Send Invite.**

Since you would be inviting different stakeholders from different parts of the API Lifecycle, you can limit and restrict who gets access to what. 

**Note:**  Learn more about organizing your team and assigning roles here: [**Workspace Roles.**](k.workspace-roles.md) 

Once sent, your invitations move to the pending invites section and your team members are sent an email invitation. When they click **Accept,** they are added to your workspace.
