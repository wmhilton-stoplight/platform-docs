# Groups

Groups allow you to organize projects in your sidebar and grant project access to users in bulk.

1. Log in to your workspace, and then select the **Groups** tab.
2. Select the **New Group** icon at the right of the header pane.
3. From the **Create New Group** page, provide a name for your group and set the [project visibility](l.project-roles.md).
4. Select **Save** to create your group.

## Project Organization

Joining groups and their projects populates your sidebar. Making public groups with public projects adds the same helpful nested structure to your external docs too.

<!-- theme: success -->
> Discover [how to populate your sidebar](../4.-documentation/Sidebar/a.customize-sidebar.md) and pin your favorite projects.
