# Groups

Groups allow you to organize projects in your sidebar and grant project access to users in bulk.

<!-- theme: info -->
> This feature is available on the Stoplight **Professional** and **Enterprise** plans.

## Project Organization

Joining groups and their projects populates your sidebar. Making public groups with public projects adds the same helpful nested structure to your external docs too.

<!-- theme: success -->
> Discover [how to populate your sidebar](../4.-documentation/Sidebar/a.customize-sidebar.md) and pin your favorite projects.

## Moving Projects
There are a couple ways to move projects into a group.

**Option 1: Move a Single Project to a Group from the Projects List**
