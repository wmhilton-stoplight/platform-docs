# Groups

<!-- theme: info -->
> This feature is available on the Stoplight **Professional** and **Enterprise** plans.

Groups provide a way to organize projects for easy navigation and maintenance.

For example, Stoplight uses groups to organize its public documentation into two groups: one primarily focused on the Stoplight platform and one for open-source products.

These groups help users navigate the documentation projects in the workspace sidebar.

Groups also make maintenance easier by organizing the Projects list. Groups are organized into collapsible folders. Folders are collapsed by default, and the list is sorted alphanumerically. You can sort the list by name, owner, type, etc.

## Create Groups

1. Log in to your workspace, and then select the **Projects** tab.
2. Select **New Group**.
3. From the **Create New Group** page, provide a name and description for the group.
4. Set the [group visibility](o.group-access.md) to public or internal.
5. Select **Save**.

When you create a group, you are automatically set as the group owner.

## Add Groups to the Sidebar

Use one of these methods to add groups to the workspace sidebar:

1. Pin one or more of the projects in the group. This controls your personal view of the sidebar.

2. Add public projects to public groups. This controls the sidebar view for non-logged in users and guests.

See [Workspace Sidebar](../4.-documentation/Sidebar/a.workspace-sidebar.md).

## Move Projects to Groups

Project owners can move individual projects in and out of groups they own. Workspace owners can move any project in and out of groups and can do so in bulk.

**Option 1: Move a Single Project to a Group**
