# Try It

Stoplight Studio enables you to preview and test your API operations as you work or as people read your documentation.

<!-- theme: info -->
> **Try It** requests from browsers will be blocked for APIs that do not have appropriate [CORS headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) set up for `*.stoplight.io`.

For each request, you can:

- Provide authorization and parameters as part of each request.
- Choose to send the request from any server defined in the API description.
- Get a [request sample](get-request-samples.md) for your preferred language type.
- Enable mocking and choose to generate static or dynamic URLs. See [Mock Servers](setting-up-a-mock-server.md).  

## Send Requests

1. Open Try It:
    - From published API documentation, select an operation. 
    - In Edit mode, select an operation, select **Preview**, and then select the **Try It** tab.
