# Get Request Samples

When you are happy with the requests you've made in [Try It](try-it.md), you can get request samples for pasting into your codebase.

To get request samples:

1. From within a project, select any API endpoint from the API sidebar menu. 
2. Modify the request as needed, then select **Send Request**.
3. In the **Request Sample** box, select a language, and then select the copy icon.

The default language is **Shell / cURL**.

### Supported Languages

> These request samples come from the open-source package [httpsnippet](https://github.com/Kong/httpsnippet), so if you'd like to contribute more, first send them a pull request then open an issue on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/stoplightio/studio/issues).
